.AVI to .MP4
-------------

That's my first personal Python project!

The ideia: Create a program with Python that converts files with the .avi extension to .mp4

Why?

I found myself with a lot of old videos made by me and some friends of mine when we were in school. So far, pretty cool to have some memories, right? 
The problem is that recently I don't have much storage available on my PC and a solution that I though would be interesting was to create this program.
The program should convert all these files in the selected directory with the extension .avi to .mp4 automatticaly, drastically reducing the space taken up by them. :)
