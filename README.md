# .AVI to .MP4
any suggestion on a cool name for this program? 

## What it does
The idea is to create a program using Python to convert video files with the .avi extension to .mp4

## Inspiration
I found myself with a lot of old videos made by me and some friends back when we were in school. So far, pretty cool to have some memories, right? 
The problem is that recently I don't have much storage available on my PC and a solution that I though would be interesting was to create this program.
The program should convert all these files in the selected directory with the extension .avi to .mp4, automatticaly, drastically reducing the space taken up by them. :)

## A few more things I've been thinking about to develop this program
- Allow converting video files to more extensions
- Create a simple interface to define the directory that will be scanned and that also allows you to view all available extensions
