.AVI to .MP4
-------------

That's my first personal Python project!

The ideia it's to create a program with Python that converts files with the .avi extension to .mp4

Why?

I found myself with a lot of old videos made by me and some friends of mine when we were in school, so far, pretty cool to have some memories. 
Recently I don't have much storage available on my PC and a solution that I though would be interesting was to create this program.
That way this could convert all those files with .avi to .mp4, a modern codec for videos that will save a lot of storage for me and all that automatticaly! hehe :)
